# USB-Rubber-Ducky-Clone-using-Arduino-Leonardo-Beetle
This project realises a basic version of the 'H4K5' USB Rubber Ducky for under $10 by utilising a $5 CJMCU Beetle board connected to a $5 Arduino compatible microSD card reader module. Only six solder connections are needed. The microSD card carries the encoded keystrokes which are to be send to the target pc.
A simple Windows application (written in C# - source included) is used to convert a command script text file into the 'script.bin' executed on duck. The scripting language is almost 100% compatible with the 'H4K5' devices at $50.
