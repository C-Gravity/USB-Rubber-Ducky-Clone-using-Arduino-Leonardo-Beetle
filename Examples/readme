Here are a number of script examples.

The textSheel example is a fully working TCP Reverse Shell implemented using microsoft Powershell code. 
The script actually 'writes' the powershell script, saves it to a file, and then excutes the script. It also sets-up a scheduled job
to execute the script after each reboot of the target machine. The shell will then form a command connection back to the attacker IP 
each time the target starts up.
